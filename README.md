# BostonStreetCaster
Sidewalk segmentation and analysis project for the city of Boston

### To segment images of sidewalks:

1. Place images into a **subdirectory** of ```/to-segment``` - **Total number of images must be a multiple of 2**
2. Run ```$ python segment_sidewalk.py```
3. Segmented images should be in the the ```segmented-images``` directory

*Note: You will need to change some absolute paths in a couple folders - TODO*
